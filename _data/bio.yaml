bio:
- <p>
    I am a rising senior at <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/">Colorado College</a>, where I am completing a B.A. in Mathematics and developing data-driven tools that sit at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, analytics and sustainability. My recent work as a Research Fellow with Colorado College’s State of the Rockies Project combines advanced spatial statistics, R/Python pipelines, and ArcGIS visualizations to quantify the socioeconomic impact of wildfires across the Rocky Mountain West.

    Beyond applied analytics, I am building Autoformalization workflows that translate informal mathematics. <b>FORMAL</b>—an AI system that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Thinking and agentic feedback loops for translating informal mathematics into Lean 4 proof scripts and prototyping Temporal Graph Neural Networks for real time transit demand. I plan to pursue a Ph.D. that lets me fuse these threads and deliver AI solutions that are mathematically rigorous, and engineered for impact.
